                <p>Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.</p>
                <p><b>Future developments.</b> Information about developments affecting Form W-9 (such as legislation
                    enacted after we release it) is at www.irs.gov/fw9.</p>
                <h2>Purpose of Form</h2>
                <p>An individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information return with the
                    IRS must obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) which may be your social security
                    number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification
                    number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN), to report on an information return the
                    amount paid to you, or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples of information
                    returns include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><br/>
                <p>• Form 1099-INT (interest earned or paid)<br/>
                    • Form 1099-DIV (dividends, including those from stocks or mutual funds)<br/>
                    • Form 1099-MISC (various types of income, prizes, awards, or gross proceeds)<br/>
                    • Form 1099-B (stock or mutual fund sales and certain other transactions by brokers)<br/>
                    • Form 1099-S (proceeds from real estate transactions)<br/>
                    • Form 1099-K (merchant card and third party network transactions)<br/>
                    • Form 1098 (home mortgage interest), 1098-E (student loan interest), 1098-T (tuition)<br/>
                    • Form 1099-C (canceled debt)<br/>
                    • Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property)
                </p><br/>
                <p>Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to provide your correct
                    TIN.</p>
                <p>If you do not return Form W-9 to the requester with a TIN, you might be subject to backup
                    withholding. See What is backup withholding? on page 2.</p><br/>

                <p>By signing the filled-out form, you:</p><br/>
                <p>1. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued),</p>
                <p>2. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or</p>
                <p>3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If applicable, you are
                    also certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share of any partnership income from a U.S.
                    trade or business is not subject to the withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively
                    connected income, and</p>
                <p>4. Certify that FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating that you are exempt from the
                    FATCA reporting, is correct. See What is FATCA reporting? on page 2 for further information.</p>
                <br/>
                <p><b>Note.</b> If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to request
                    your TIN, you must use the requester’s form if it is substantially similar to this Form W-9.</p>
            <pre class="zjy-pre"><b>Definition of a U.S. person.</b> For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:
    • An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;
    • A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States;
    • An estate (other than a foreign estate); or
    • A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).
<b>Special rules for partnerships.</b> Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 1446 on any foreign partners’ share of effectively connected taxable income from such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.
In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States:
    • In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the disregarded entity and not the entity;
    • In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally, the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the trust; and
    • In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust.
<b>Foreign person.</b> If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).
<b>Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien.</b> Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a “saving clause.” Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.
    If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following five items:
    1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.
    2. The treaty article addressing the income.
    3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving clause and its exceptions.
    4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.
    5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty article.
<b><em>Example.</em></b> Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the information described above to support that exemption.
    If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.

<h2>Backup Withholding</h2><b>What is backup withholding?</b> Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 28% of such payments. This is called “backup withholding.” Payments that may be subject to backup withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup withholding.
    You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.
<b>Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:</b>   1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,
    2. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the Part II instructions on page 3 for details),
    3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN,
    4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest and dividends only), or
    5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened after 1983 only).

    Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See Exempt payee code on page 3 and the separate Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.

    Also see Special rules for partnerships above.

<h2>What is FATCA reporting?</h2>
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign financial institution to report all United States account holders that are specified United States persons. Certain payees are exempt from FATCA reporting. See Exemption from FATCA reporting code on page 3 and the Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.

<h2>Updating Your Information</h2>
You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account; for example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.
<h2>Penalties</h2>
<b>Failure to furnish TIN.</b>If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.
<b>Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding.</b> If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding, you are subject to a $500 penalty.
<b>Criminal penalty for falsifying information.</b> Willfully falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.
<b>Misuse of TINs.</b> If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal law, the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.

<h2>Specific Instructions</h2>
<h3>Line 1</h3>
You must enter one of the following on this line; <strong>do not</strong> leave this line blank. The name should match the name on your tax return.
If this Form W-9 is for a joint account, list first, and then circle, the name of the person or entity whose number you entered in Part I of Form ,<strong>W-9.</strong>
a. <strong>Individual.</strong> Generally, enter the name shown on your tax return. If you have changed your last name without informing the Social Security Administration (SSA) of the name change, enter your first name, the last name as shown on your social security card, and your new last name.

<strong>Note. ITIN applicant:</strong> Enter your individual name as it was entered on your Form W-7 application, line 1a. This should also be the same as the name you entered on the Form 1040/1040A/1040EZ you filed with your application.
b. <strong>Sole proprietor or single-member LLC.</strong> Enter your individual name as shown on your 1040/1040A/1040EZ on line 1. You may enter your business, trade, or “doing business as” (DBA) name on line 2.
c. <strong>Partnership, LLC that is not a single-member LLC, C Corporation, or S Corporation. </strong>Enter the entity's name as shown on the entity's tax return on line 1 and any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.
d. <strong>Other entities.</strong> Enter your name as shown on required U.S. federal tax documents on line 1. This name should match the name shown on the charter or other legal document creating the entity. You may enter any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.
e. <strong>Disregarded entity.</strong> For U.S. federal tax purposes, an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is treated as a “disregarded entity.” See Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iii). Enter the owner's name on line 1. The name of the entity entered on line 1 should never be a disregarded entity. The name on line 1 should be the name shown on the income tax return on which the income should be reported. For example, if a foreign LLC that is treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a single owner that is a U.S. person, the U.S. owner's name is required to be provided on line 1. If the direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner that is not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the disregarded entity's name on line 2, “Business name/disregarded entity name.” If the owner of the disregarded entity is a foreign person, the owner must complete an appropriate Form W-8 instead of a Form W-9.

<h3>Line 5</h3>
Enter your address (number, street, and apartment or suite number). This is where the requester of this Form W-9 will mail your information returns.

<h3>Line 6</h3>
Enter your city, state, and ZIP code.

<h2>Part I. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)</h2>
<strong>Enter your TIN in the appropriate box.</strong> If you are a resident alien and you do not have and are not eligible to get an SSN, your TIN is your IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Enter it in the social security number box. If you do not have an ITIN, see How to get a TIN below.
    If you are a sole proprietor and you have an EIN, you may enter either your SSN or EIN. However, the IRS prefers that you use your SSN.
    If you are a single-member LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (see Limited Liability Company (LLC) on this page), enter the owner’s SSN (or EIN, if the owner has one). Do not enter the disregarded entity’s EIN. If the LLC is classified as a corporation or partnership, enter the entity’s EIN.
    <strong>Note.</strong> See the chart on page 4 for further clarification of name and TIN combinations.
    <strong>How to get a TIN.</strong> If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, from your local SSA office or get this form online at www.ssa.gov. You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at www.irs.gov/businesses and clicking on Employer Identification Number (EIN) under Starting a Business. You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS by visiting IRS.gov or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676).
    If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN and write “Applied For” in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the requester.
    <strong>Note.</strong> Entering “Applied For” means that you have already applied for a TIN or that you intend to apply for one soon.
    <strong>Caution:</strong> A disregarded U.S. entity that has a foreign owner must use the appropriate Form W-8.

<h2>Part II. Certification</h2>
To establish to the withholding agent that you are a U.S. person, or resident alien, sign Form W-9. You may be requested to sign by the withholding agent even if items 1, 4, or 5 below indicate otherwise.
For a joint account, only the person whose TIN is shown in Part I should sign (when required). In the case of a disregarded entity, the person identified on line 1 must sign. Exempt payees, see Exempt payee code earlier.
<strong>Signature requirements.</strong> Complete the certification as indicated in items 1 through 5 below.
    <strong>1. Interest, dividend, and barter exchange accounts opened before 1984 and broker accounts considered active during 1983.</strong> You must give your correct TIN, but you do not have to sign the certification.
    <strong>2. Interest, dividend, broker, and barter exchange accounts opened after 1983 and broker accounts considered inactive during 1983.</strong> You must sign the certification or backup withholding will apply. If you are subject to backup withholding and you are merely providing your correct TIN to the requester, you must cross out item 2 in the certification before signing the form.
    <strong>3. Real estate transactions.</strong> You must sign the certification. You may cross out item 2 of the certification.
    <strong>4. Other payments.</strong> You must give your correct TIN, but you do not have to sign the certification unless you have been notified that you have previously given an incorrect TIN. “Other payments” include payments made in the course of the requester’s trade or business for rents, royalties, goods (other than bills for merchandise), medical and health care services (including payments to corporations), payments to a nonemployee for services, payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, payments to certain fishing boat crew members and fishermen, and gross proceeds paid to attorneys (including payments to corporations).
    <strong>5. Mortgage interest paid by you, acquisition or abandonment of secured property, cancellation of debt, qualified tuition program payments (under section 529), IRA, Coverdell ESA, Archer MSA or HSA contributions or distributions, and pension distributions.</strong> You must give your correct TIN, but you do not have to sign the certification.

            <h3>Secure Your Tax Records from Identity Theft</h3>
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your name, SSN, or other identifying information, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.
    To reduce your risk:
• Protect your SSN,
• Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and
• Be careful when choosing a tax preparer.
    If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a notice from the IRS, respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS notice or letter.
    If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think you are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable credit card activity or credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 1-800-908-4490 or submit Form 14039.
    For more information, see Publication 4535, Identity Theft Prevention and Victim Assistance.
    Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a system problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that have not been resolved through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the TAS toll-free case intake line at 1-877-777-4778 or TTY/TDD 1-800-829-4059.
<strong>Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes.</strong> Phishing is the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.
    The IRS does not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does not request personal detailed information through email or ask taxpayers for the PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their credit card, bank, or other financial accounts.
    If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this message to phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo, or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at 1-800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal Trade Commission at: spam@uce.gov or contact them at www.ftc.gov/idtheft or 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338).
    Visit IRS.gov to learn more about identity theft and how to reduce your risk.

<h3>Privacy Act Notice</h3>
Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct TIN to persons (including federal agencies) who are required to file information returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other income paid to you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of secured property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA, Archer MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this form uses the information on the form to file information returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their laws. The information also may be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax return. Under section 3406, payers must generally withhold a percentage of taxable interest, dividend, and certain other payments to a payee who does not give a TIN to the payer. Certain penalties may also apply for providing false or fraudulent information.
