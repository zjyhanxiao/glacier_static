The undersigned (the “Investor”) subscribes for and agrees to purchase a limited partnership interest (an “Interest”), in Meixin Flexible Balanced Strategies Fund LP (the “Partnership”), in the amount as set forth on the signature page below.  The Investor acknowledges that this subscription (a) is irrevocable, and (b) is conditioned upon acceptance by or on behalf of Meixin Management LLC, the general partner of the Partnership (the “General Partner”), or its delegate(s), and may be accepted or rejected in whole or in part by the General Partner or its delegate(s) in its respective sole and absolute discretion.  The Investor acknowledges that he or she is bound by all the terms and provisions of the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Partnership (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Limited Partnership Agreement”).  Capitalized terms not defined herein are used as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement.</p>
                            <p class="li_p_suojin">2.Representations and Warranties.  To induce the Partnership to accept this subscription, the Investor represents and warrants as follows:</p>
                            <p class="li_p_suojin">(a)The Investor has been furnished the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum of the Partnership (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Memorandum”) (collectively with Limited Partnership Agreement, the “Partnership Documents”) and has carefully read the Partnership Documents.  The Investor has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Partnership, is able to bear the risks of an investment in the Partnership and understands the risks of, and other considerations relating to, a purchase of the Interests, including the matters set forth under the caption “Certain Risks and Potential Conflicts of Interest” in the Memorandum.</p>
                            <p class="li_p_suojin">(b)The Investor (i) will not transfer or deliver the Interests, or any interest therein, except in accordance with the restrictions set forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement and (ii) is acquiring the Interests to be acquired hereunder for the Investor’s own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to assignment, resale or distribution. The Investor has no need for liquidity in this investment, can afford a complete loss of the investment in the Interests and can afford to hold the investment for an indefinite period of time.</p>
                            <p class="li_p_suojin">(c)The Investor understands that the Interests have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the securities laws of any state or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, nor is such registration contemplated.  The Interests are offered and sold in the United States under the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and other exemptions of similar import in the laws of the states and other jurisdictions where the offering is made.  The Investor also understands that the Partnership does not file and does not intend to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other regulatory authority.  The Investor also understands that the Partnership is not, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).  The Investor also</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>understands that the Partnership has not agreed to register the Interests for distribution in any jurisdiction, and that the Partnership has not agreed to comply with any exemption under the laws of any jurisdiction for the resale of the Interests.  The Investor understands and agrees further that, subject to the limited withdrawal rights set forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement, the Interests must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act and these laws or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and these laws covering the sale of the Interests is available.  Even if such an exemption is available, the assignability and transferability of the Interests will be governed by the Limited Partnership Agreement, which imposes substantial restrictions on transfer.  The Investor understands that legends stating that the Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act and these laws and setting out or referring to the restrictions on the transferability and resale of the Interests will be placed on all documents, if any, evidencing the Interests.</p>
                        <p class="li_p_suojin">(d)The Investor’s overall commitment to the Partnership and other investments that are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Investor’s net worth and the Investor has no need for immediate liquidity in the Investor’s investment in the Partnership.</p>
                        <p class="li_p_suojin">(e)To the full satisfaction of the Investor, the Investor has been furnished with all materials the Investor has requested relating to the Partnership (including the Partnership Documents), the offering of the Interests or any statement made in the Memorandum, and the Investor has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the offering and to obtain any additional information necessary to verify the accuracy of any representations or information set forth in the Memorandum.</p>
