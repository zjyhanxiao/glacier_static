                            <h4>Securities Products</h4>
                            <p>The securities offered on the Site are only suitable for sophisticated and high net
                                worth investors who are familiar

                                with and willing to accept the high risks associated with private investments.
                                Securities sold through private

                                placements are not publicly traded and, therefore, are illiquid unless registered
                                with the Securities and Exchange

                                Commission. Additionally, securities may be subject to restrictions on resale or
                                transfer including holding period

                                requirements. Investing in private placements requires high risk tolerance, low
                                liquidity need, and long-term

                                commitments. Users must be able to afford to lose their entire investment.
                                Investment products are not FDIC

                                insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.</p>
                            <p>The securities being offered have not been registered under the Securities Act, in
                                reliance, among other exemptions,

                                on the exemptive provisions of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Similar
                                reliance has been placed on

                                apparently available exemptions from securities registration or qualification
                                requirements under applicable state

                                securities laws. No assurance can be given that any offering currently qualifies or
                                will continue to qualify under one

                                or more of such exemptive provisions due to, among other things, the adequacy of
                                disclosure and the manner of

                                distribution, the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future, or a
                                change of any securities law or

                                regulation that has retroactive effect. No governmental agency has reviewed the
                                offerings posted on this Site and no

                                state or federal agency has passed upon either the adequacy of the disclosure
                                contained herein or the fairness of the

                                terms of any offering. The exemptions relied upon for such offerings are
                                significantly dependent upon the accuracy

                                of the representations of the Users to be made to the Site and issuers on the Site
                                in connection with the offering. In

                                the event that any such representations prove to be untrue, the registration
                                exemptions relied upon by an Issuer in

                                selling the securities might not be available and substantial liability to such
                                Issuer would result under applicable

                                securities laws for rescission or damages. These risks are non-exhaustive and are
                                intended to highlight certain risks

                                associate with investing in securities that are not registered with the Securities
                                and Exchange Commission. WE

                                STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO CONSULT A LEGAL, TAX AND FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL BEFORE

                                INVESTING, AND CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL THE SPECIFIC RISK DISCLOSURES PROVIDED AS PART

                                OF ANY OFFERING MATERIALS AND ASK THE ISSUER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE OR

                                REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.</p>
                            <p>Meixin receives no commission or transaction-based compensation in connection with
                                the purchase or sale of

                                securities through the Site but may receive fixed fees for services. Meixin is not a
                                registered broker-dealer, funding

                                portal, investment adviser or investment manager, and does not offer investment
                                advice or advise on the raising of

                                capital through securities offerings. Meixin does not recommend or otherwise suggest
                                that any investor make an

                                investment in a particular offering, or that any Issuer offer securities to a
                                particular Investor. Meixin takes no part in

                                the negotiation or execution of transactions for the purchase or sale of securities
                                and at no time has possession of

                                funds or securities. Meixin cannot guarantee that Issuers on the Site will use the
                                proceeds of any offering in

                                accordance with the stated purpose. Users acknowledge and agree that Meixin makes no
                                representation, warranty or

                                assurance that the offering posted on the Site are made in accordance with Federal
                                and/or state securities law,

                                including the exemption to the sale of unregistered securities, or the legality of
                                any offerings therein.</p>

                            <h4>Indirect Investments</h4>
                            <p>Generally, an investor can either invest directly in a real estate project where you
                                own title the property or shares in

                                the title owning entity (“Direct Investment”) or invest indirectly by purchasing
                                securities issued by a special purpose

                                investment fund (“Investment Fund”), a separate limited liability company created
                                for the sole purpose of investing

                                in the Issuer or acquire the property. Investors in the Investment Fund are not the
                                record holders of the portfolio

                                company or direct titleholders of the real estate asset but instead become members
                                of the Investment Fund. The

                                Investment Funds are managed by an investment advisor and/or managing member in
                                accordance with the terms of

                                each fund’s operating documents. THE INVESTMENT MANAGER FOR THE INDIRECT OFFERINGS
                                POSTED

                                ON THE SITE MAY BE AN AFFILIATE OF MEIXIN.</p>
                            <p>In an Investment Fund, the investment manager manages, controls, and conducts the
                                affairs of the fund. Members

                                have limited voting rights. Investors in the Investment Fund may be charged an
                                administrative fee to cover the actual

                                out-of-pocket costs of the Investment Fund; the administrative fee is disclosed to
                                the investors at the time of the

                                formation. Investors in an Investment Fund have the benefit of the investment
                                manager’s experience in the related

                                transactions. An investment manager may receive a share of any profit of the
                                Investment Fund for providing

                                management services (“carried interest”), but may not receive any transaction based
                                fees such as commission. Terms

                                may vary so you are required to read all offering materials carefully and consult
                                with your legal, financial and

                                investment counsel. The foregoing description is non-exhaustive and should not be
                                deemed to be legal advice.</p>

                            <p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by, construed and entered in accordance with the
                                laws of the State of New

                                York applicable to contracts deemed to be made within such state, without regard to
                                choice of law or conflict of law

                                provisions thereof. YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO
                                ANY

                                CLAIM, ACTION OR PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO,

                                THESE TERMS OF USE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

                                ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY

                                TRIAL.</p>
                            <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
                            <p>In the event of any claim, controversy or alleged dispute between you and Meixin, its
                                members or affiliates

                                ("Dispute"), you hereby agree to attempt in good faith to amicably resolve any
                                Dispute at least thirty (30) days

                                before instituting any legal proceeding. Each party agrees to submit any Dispute for
                                resolution by final binding

                                arbitration after serving written notice, which notice shall set forth in detail the
                                controversy, question, claim or

                                alleged breach along with your attempt to resolve such Dispute. Upon such notice and
                                attempt to resolve, the party

                                may then commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the rules of the American
                                Arbitration Association

                                ("AAA") to be held in the State of New York, New York City, before an arbitrator to
                                be selected by the AAA. Any

                                such arbitration may only be commenced within one year after the party requesting
                                arbitration obtains knowledge of

                                the cause of action forming the basis of the controversy or claim accrued.</p>
                            <p>In any arbitration and subject to the ultimate discretion of the presiding
                                arbitrator, each side will be limited to a

                                maximum of one (1) day of argument (including rebuttal), and the parties agree in
                                good faith to minimize discovery

                                burdens (e.g. confine the scope to actual areas in dispute and limit the topics and
                                number of pages on which

                                information is requested to matters directly relevant). The decision(s) of the
                                arbitrator shall be final and binding and

                                may not be appealed to any court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, except
                                upon claim of fraud or corruption

                                as by law provided, provided, however, that implementation of such decision(s) shall
                                in no way be delayed or

                                otherwise impaired pending the outcome of any such appeal. Judgment upon the award
                                rendered in such arbitration

                                may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. You agree that all Disputes
                                will be limited between you,

                                individually, and Meixin. To the full extent allowable by law, you agree that no
                                arbitration proceeding or other

                                dispute resolution proceeding shall be joined with any other party or decided on a
                                class-action basis.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that the following matters shall not, at the
                                election of Meixin, be subject to

                                binding arbitration: (1) any Dispute related to, or arising from allegations of
                                criminal activity; (2) any Disputes

                                concerning Meixin’s intellectual property rights; and (3) any claim for injunctive
                                relief. All arbitration proceedings

                                will take place in the State of New York, New York City, United States of America.
                                Any Dispute not subject to

                                arbitration shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within New York
                                City. Each party hereby waives

                                any claim that such venue is improper or inconvenient.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Indemnification</h4>
                            <p>To the fullest extent permissible by law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold
                                Meixin and any of its affiliates,

                                and any of its successors and assigns, and any of their respective officers,
                                directors, employees, agents,

                                representatives, licensors, advertisers, suppliers, and operational service
                                providers harmless from and against any

                                and all claims, actions, losses, expenses, damages and costs (including reasonable
                                attorneys' fees), resulting from

                                any breach or violation of these Terms of Use by you or arising from your use of the
                                Site. Meixin reserves the right

                                to assume, at its sole expense, the exclusive defense and control of any such claim
                                or action and all negotiations for

                                settlement or compromise, and you agree to fully cooperate with Meixin in the
                                defense of any such claim, action,

                                settlement or compromise negotiations, as requested by Meixin.</p>

                            <h4>Notification Procedures</h4>
                            <p>We may provide notifications, including those regarding modifications to these Terms
                                of Use, whether such

                            <h4>Communications</h4>
                            <p>You agree that Meixin may send communications to you via your mailing address, email,
                                telephone or facsimile

                                number provided by you on your Account. You agree to notify us of any changes in
                                your address or contact details.

                                Meixin may also deliver information verbally. Communications shall be deemed

                                Meixin in any manner including, but

                                purpose. Meixin is free to use any idea, concepts, know-how, techniques, etc.
                                contained in any communication to the

                            <h4>Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act/Uniform Electronic
                                Transactions Act</h4>
                            <p>The Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“ESIGN”) and
                                similar state laws,

                                particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”), authorize the
                                creation of legally binding and

                                enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures. ESIGN and UETA
                                require businesses that want

                                to use electronic records or signatures in consumer transactions to obtain the
                                consumer’s consent to receive

                                information electronically. When an Issuer or potential Investor registers on the
                                platform, we obtain his or her

                                consent to transact business electronically and maintain electronic records in
                                compliance with ESIGN and UETA

                                requirements. Your use of electronic signatures to sign documents legally binds you
                                in the same manner as if you

                                had manually signed such documents. The use of electronic versions of documents
                                fully satisfies any requirement

                                that such documents be provided to you in writing. If you sign electronically, you
                                represent that you have the ability

                                to access and retain a record of such documents. You agree that you are responsible
                                for understanding these

                                documents and agree to conduct business by electronic means. You are obligated to
                                review the Site periodically for

                                changes and modifications and agree not to contest the admissibility or
                                enforceability the Site's electronically stored

                                copy of this Agreement in any proceeding arising out of this Agreement.</p>
                            <p>Although you consent to electronic delivery, you may elect to deliver communications
                                by other means and such

                                delivery shall not affect your consent. You may revoke consent to electronic
                                delivery of communications and

                                receive a paper version at your election. Meixin shall have a reasonable period to
                                effect such a change and Meixin

                                may charge you a reasonable fee for sending such paper copies. If you elect to use
                                electronic delivery, you agree and

                                represent that you have a suitable computer with Internet access, an email address
                                and the availability to download,

                                save and/or print communications to retain a record of such communications. You
                                agree that you are solely

                                responsible for maintaining such equipment and services required for online
                                access.</p>

                            <h4>Integration and Severability</h4>
                            <p>The failure of Meixin to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will
                                not constitute a waiver of future

                                enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision
                                will be effective only if in writing

                                and signed by a duly authorized representative of Meixin. These Terms of Use and
                                other referenced materials are the

                                entire agreement between you and Meixin with respect to the Service, and supersede
                                all prior or contemporaneous

                                communication and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and
                                Meixin with respect to the

                                Service and govern the future relationship. Except as expressly set forth in these
                                Terms of Use, the exercise by either

                                party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Use will be without prejudice to
                                its other remedies under these

                                Terms of Use or otherwise. If for any reason a court or arbitral, as applicable, of
                                competent jurisdiction finds any

                                provision of these Terms of Use invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be
                                enforced to the maximum extent

                                permissible and the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force
