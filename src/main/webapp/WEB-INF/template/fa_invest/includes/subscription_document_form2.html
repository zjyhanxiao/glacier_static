                        requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other regulatory
                        authority. The Investor also understands that the Portfolio is not, and will not be, registered
                        under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). The
                        Investor also understands that neither the Portfolio or the Fund has agreed to register the
                        Investor Shares for distribution in any jurisdiction, and that neither the Portfolio or the Fund

                        are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Investor’s net worth and the Investor
                        has no need for immediate liquidity in the Investor’s investment in the Portfolio.
                    </div>
