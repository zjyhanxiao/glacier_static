                            <p>Meixin takes steps to safeguard your personal information through vigorous physical,
                                electronic and

                                operational policies and practices.  Data can only be read or written through
                                defined service access points,

                                the use of which is password-protected.  The physical security of the data is
                                achieved through a

                                combination of network firewalls (there is no direct communication allowed between
                                the database server

                                and the Internet) and servers with hardened operating systems are all housed in a
                                secure facility.  Access

                                to the system, both physical and electronic, is tightly controlled and limited to
                                only those employees or

                                third parties who have a need to know.  We do not allow visibility of your Social

                                account information, or credit card information via the Site.  Further, we also
                                equip our servers with

                                Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate technology to ensure that when you connect to
                                our Site you are

                                actually on our Site. SSL also ensures that all data entered into the Site are
                                encrypted. To verify that SSL

                                is being used, look for the key or padlock icon on your browser. For further
                                encryption protection, we use

                                a 128-bit secure browser for logins and transactions.</p>
                            <p>Although Meixin has a stringent process in place to prevent fraudulent persons from

                                identities to acquire loans, there are still limited times when identity theft
                                occurs. Meixin will work with

                                law enforcement authorities to track down and prosecute persons who have committed
                                identity theft.</p>

                            <p>At a minimum, we require the use of both numbers and letters in your password. We
                                have also instituted

                                secure steps by which you can regain access to your account should you forget your
                                password, including

                                the use of a security question. Your password is not known to any employee or third
                                party with whom we

                                may partner, and we will never ask for your password as a means of identifying
                                yourself. You should

                                never share your password with anyone, and if you ever receive an email purporting
                                to come

                                from Meixin that asks for your password, you should immediately report this
                                development.</p>
                            <p>In addition to our own substantial efforts, you can take several precautions to
                                protect the security of your

                                computer and personal information. For instance, you can start by using a
                                well-chosen password. You

                                should avoid using any information that others can easily learn about you, such as a
                                family member’s

                                name or birthday, and you can also use special characters in place of letters. In
                                addition, we recommend

                                that you change your password frequently.</p>
                            <p>You can install and regularly update antivirus and firewall software to protect your
                                computer from

                                external attacks by malicious users. When you are finished with a session on our
                                site, be sure that you log

                                out and close the browser window.</p>
                            <p>To protect your account, we send automatic notifications confirming certain actions
                                taken on your

                                account, such as changes to a password or external linked account. We do this for
                                your own protection so

                                that you can be sure no one else is making changes to your account without your
                                knowledge. However,

                                the security offered through these notifications can be undermined if other people
                                have access to your

                                email account. Therefore, you might consider restricting access to the email account
                                you registered with

                                on this site and/or changing your password on that email account frequently.</p>
                            <p>If you use a computer that is accessed by other people, such as in a public library
                                or Internet cafe, we

                                recommend that you take special precautions to protect the security of your Account
                                and personal data.

                                When you are finished using our Site, you should log out completely, then close the
                                browser window and

                                clear the browser’s cache files.</p>
                            <p>You should also be aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access to your account
                                information known as

                                "phishing." Phishing is a tactic used by scammers in which unsuspecting people are
                                brought to a website

                                by a genuine-looking email purporting to be from a legitimate company. The phony or
                                "spoof" email

                                takes the person to a website that looks legitimate but in fact is not. Either in
                                the email itself or on this

                                fake site, scammers will ask for login information to gain access to people’s
                                accounts and withdraw their

                                money.</p>
                            <p>Meixin will never ask you for your login information in the context of any email. In
                                general, you can

                                protect yourself against phishing by never providing personal or login information
                                via an email—instead,

                                go the website directly. You might also make it a habit to check the URL of a
                                website to be sure that it

                                begins with the correct domain. In the case of Meixin, you should always ensure the
                                URL begins with

                                <a href="http://www.meixinfinance.com"
